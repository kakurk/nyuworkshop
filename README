# Overview of the Workshop
# 1. XNAT
#   Talk about XNAT. What is it. Why is it useful.
#   Show off BU's XNAT interface. Talk about the current dataset.
        # "burcs" is a dataset taken from the Nathan Klein Insititue for Psycharitci Research's Rockland Sample.
        # It contains high resolution T1w anatomic scans, several resting state scans, visual checkerboard scans,
        # and some diffusion weighted scans.
        # Its purpose here is simply to serve as test data for our research computing group. In other words, to be
        # able to put on workshops like this one!
# 2. YAXIL and Retreiving Data from XNAT
#   - You can download data manually via the web interface. Show this off.
#   - Show Harvard NRG's GITHUB page, including YAXIL
#   - Show off how to install it via a python virtual enviornment, pip
#   - Show off how to set up your xnat credentials
#   - Show off how to download an entire project worth of data using some python code
#   - Show off how to download a single session using ArcGet.py
# 3. Organizing data and BIDS
#   - What is BIDS? Why do we need it? Why should you use it?
#   - The dcm2bids package is a nice tool for doing conversions.
#   - Show off the dcm2bids documentation, the config file
#   - Show off how to run dcm2bids, the help, options
#   - pip install dcm2bids? Appears to be pretty easy...
# 4. Assessing data quality using MRIQC
#   - installation is a bit more complex. I suggest using a docker or singularity container
#   - explain a singularity container
#   - show how easy it is to run QA on a dataset once it is set up properly
#   - Go over
